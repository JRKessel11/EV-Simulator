#EV-Simulator
Simple Python simulation of expected value and drawdowns for a probability-based strategy

This short project simulates a probability-based simulation to compare theoretical expected value with realized outcomes over many trials.
The simulator created tracks:
  - Theoretical expected value per trade
  - Simulated expected value per trade
  - total profit
  - simulated win rate
  - max drawdown

What concept this reinforced:
  - Variance affects any strategy you put into place, even ones with high or positive expected value.
